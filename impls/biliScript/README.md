AkariX biliScript

This is the biliScript implementation of AkariX. This implementation serves as a reference for others in the context of content fidelity. This is the direct descendant of Akari.biliScript, with much code borrowed from the original project.

How to Use
----------

1. Build with `build.rb`
2. Paste result into bilibili Flash Player
3. After the framework code executed, run `AkariX.execute(userProgram);` Where `userProgram` is a JS Object representation of the Composition Tree.
